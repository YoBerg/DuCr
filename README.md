## The Game
DuCr is a turn-based dungeon crawler game. Each enemy waits a certain number of 'player turns' (depending on the enemy type) before they move. The objective is to take on the Zones. Each zone is equipped with 3 randomly generated floors and a boss floor. Specific rewards and unlocks are granted upon the boss' defeat. Most floors will require a certain objective to be completed before the player can progress through the ladder. In most cases it is a button that must be discovered and pressed while in others it may be defeated a greater enemy. DuCr is not designed to allow the player to refresh after battles. This means the player will not regenerate health upon floor completion or zone completion and must buy and use health potions or regain their health in another way.
